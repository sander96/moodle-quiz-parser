# Environment setup

1. Install docker and docker-compose.
1. Change `docker-compose.yml` environment variables and port (default port is `8090`).
1. Run `docker-compose up -d`. This can take some time.
1. Go to http://localhost:8090.

More information about environment variables and advanced configuration can be found in https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/moodle.
